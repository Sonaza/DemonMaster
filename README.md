# DemonMaster
Simple helper addon for demon handling for warlocks in World of Warcraft.

## Description
Tired of fiddly flyout menus to summon your demons? Doesn't your keybinds get sometimes confusing? Introducing DemonMaster, the new favorite of every practicing demon summoner.

With this addon a warlock can open up a simple dialog where they can type the name of the demon. Immediately when a match is found you can hit the enter once to confirm it is the right one and second time to summon it.

The addon automatically detects if you have Grimoire of Supremacy talent selected and will even match the demon names: "Succubus" and "Shivarra" will both find the correct demon regardless of your current talent selection. Additionally only demons that you can summon are displayed.

The addon /should/ work with all/most locales though it has only been tested with the English one.

### Usage

To begin with you must assign a key bind for the dialog. In case one has not been set the addon should prompt for it. If not, go to the Key Bindings menu from the Game Menu (hint: press ESC) and then browse to AddOns category. From there you will find the option to bind a key.

After you are all set with the key binding you can hit it whenever you like provided you are only out of combat and start summoning!

## Dependencies
DemonMaster uses Ace3 which is included in the /libs directory.
